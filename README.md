## 147 Republican Traitors and Contributors

This is a dataset of all the 147 Republican traitors and their contributors that voted to overturn the election results in Congress. This is the raw aggregated data, please feel free to use.

The source data is from Open Secrets and is organized into two files:

1. CSV of all traitors - 147_traitors.csv
2. CSV of all contributors to the traitors, raw data - 147_contributors.csv
3. CSV of sorted top list of all contributors - 147_contributors_top_list.csv

## Goal

To make sure these traitors lose their positions in Congress.

1. Contact them - make your voice be heard
2. Contact contributors - drain their campaign cash
3. Get ready for their upcoming elections
4. Help find more ways to get them out of Congress

We do not support any use of violence or threats of violence in this campaign.
